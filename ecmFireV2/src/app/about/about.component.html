    <!-- <h4>ABOUT US:</h4> -->
    
    <h5>From the beginning:</h5> <p>Our entry into the equestrian community in 2009 began as 
        a result of a young girl's love of ponies. It has since grown into a passion 
        for the development and management of show horses with an emphasis on hunter, 
        jumper and equitation disciplines.</p>
<hr/>
    <p>EILEEN McDONNELL has been "groom" at her daughter Claire's side, all while 
        serving as CEO at a major U.S. life insurer. Since "giving up the reins" 
        in corporate America, Eileen has been focused on further strengthening 
        their equestrian roots.</p>
<hr/>
    <h5>What Differentiates ECM:</h5><p>Care and connectedness is a part of the goods and 
        services that our horses experience as a part of daily life. Don't be surprised 
        when you come to visit with us that our horses enthusiastically offer welcoming 
        greetings.</p>

    <p>At ECM, you'll find that all horses have been treated with love and compassion, 
        which ultimately impacts their performance.</p>
    
    <p>That loving care extends to every aspect of compassionate and consistence in 
        managing, training and producing our award-winning horses.</p>
